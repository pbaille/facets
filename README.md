# FOO

### Functionaly Object Oriented

Pseudo types and polymorphism for clj and cljs.

I would love feedback on this, good or bad.

### Why?

- Creating new types easily.
- Extend core types without having to write painful deftypes
- Share implementations.

## Usage

see source, one ns < 300loc

## Disclaimer

Early stage of development, performance optimisations are not yet adressed, error handling should be correct but i've not written any tests yet.
